## Overview

muse2api turns muse.ai's chat, text-to-image and text-to-video features into standard OpenAI endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/images/generations`, ...). Existing OpenAI SDKs and clients such as ChatGPT-Next-Web, LobeChat or Cherry Studio work by just changing their `base_url`.

The project focuses on **clean engineering and easy collaboration**:

- **Pluggable drivers**: how we reach upstream is abstracted behind a `MuseDriver` interface. There are currently a mock driver, a browser (CDP) driver and a direct HTTP/Noise driver. They are fully independent of each other.
- **Strict layering**: the protocol layer, service layer, account pool and drivers each have a single responsibility and can be developed and tested on their own.
- **Fully async**: built on FastAPI + asyncio; the CDP client uses `websockets`, so no request ever blocks a thread.
- **Account pool**: multiple scheduling strategies, per-account concurrency limits, cooldown after failures, automatic removal of expired sessions, and automatic failover to another account.
- **Offline development**: the mock driver needs no account and makes no network calls, so front-end and protocol work can move forward independently.

## Status

> **Current**: the mock-driver test suite passes locally (no network access) and CI runs on every push to main. The direct HTTP driver has been live-tested for text chat, image input, image generation/download and workspace uploads. Live video generation is implemented but the test account is region-restricted by upstream; browser checks remain.

| Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI protocol layer (chat streaming/non-streaming, images, videos, models) | ✅ Implemented | Multi-turn chat, system prompts, image input, model aliases |
| Account pool (scheduling / cooldown / invalidation / failover) | ✅ Implemented | `lru`, `round_robin` and `affinity` strategies |
| Background tasks (video) | ✅ Implemented | Create a task, then poll for the result; unfinished tasks are marked interrupted after a restart |
| Admin API (account CRUD, renewal, reset, status) | ✅ Implemented | Accepts cookie dicts, raw `Cookie` header strings and EditThisCookie JSON, plus bulk import via `/admin/accounts/import`; per-account quota snapshot at `/admin/accounts/{id}/quota` |
| Mock driver | ✅ Implemented | Offline fake data |
| Browser driver (Chromium + CDP) | 🧪 Needs live testing | Full chat, image and video flows are written |
| Session renewal / keepalive | 🧪 Needs live testing | Plain HTTP, disabled by default; HTTP token refresh is implemented |
| Direct HTTP protocol driver | ✅ Implemented | Noise WebSocket transport, chat/image input/image generation/download and workspace files live-tested. Video path is implemented; the test account's region restriction prevents a live video check. See [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) |
| `/v1/images/edits` (reference images) | ✅ Implemented | Images are references for a new image; `mask` is rejected |
| `/v1/responses` | 🚧 Reserved | Returns 501 |
| Streaming heartbeats (SSE keepalive) | ✅ Implemented | Opt-in with `MUSE2API_STREAM_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`; sends `: keepalive` comments while waiting for the first token |
| Automatic media cleanup | ✅ Implemented | `MUSE2API_MEDIA_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 14, `0` disables); hourly background pruning |
| SSRF guard for server-side image fetches | ✅ Implemented | Private and loopback URLs are rejected |
| Web dashboard, request log, multiple API keys | ✅ Implemented | Dashboard at `/dashboard`; key CRUD at `/admin/keys`; per-request log and aggregates |
| Quota lookup | 🧪 Needs real driver | Mock driver returns a fake snapshot; browser/http drivers are not wired up yet |
| Cookie import browser extension | 🚧 Reserved | |
| Storage backends (SQLite / Redis) | 🚧 Reserved | Accounts still use a JSON store; the request log is SQLite |
| Prometheus metrics | 🚧 Reserved | Basic aggregates exist at `/admin/stats` |

**How a chat request is handled**: the route resolves the model alias and merges the multi-turn `messages` into a single prompt, then hands it to the Gateway. The Gateway leases an account from the pool and asks the driver for a text stream. On failure, the account's state is updated according to the error type: accounts with an expired session are taken offline, accounts out of quota cool down, and other errors cause a short cooldown. As long as nothing has been sent to the client yet, the request is retried on another account.

For streaming requests, the first chunk is fetched before returning 200. Errors such as "no account available" or "upstream authentication failed" therefore come back with a proper HTTP status code instead of a stream that breaks halfway.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full design and [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) for the direct HTTP/Noise protocol.

## Quick start

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/www222fff/muse2api.git
cd muse2api
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
cp .env.example .env      # defaults to MUSE2API_DRIVER=mock, no account needed
python -m muse2api        # listens on http://127.0.0.1:18610 by default
```

If `MUSE2API_API_KEY` is not set, a key is generated on first start and saved to `data/api_key`.

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Use a real account

Export the cookies from a browser that is logged in to muse.ai. At least `hatch_sess`, `hatch_vml` and `hatch_native_auth_device` are required (`hatch_gw` may appear in older exports); then import the account through the Admin API (see the example below).

**HTTP driver (no Chromium)**

1. Set `MUSE2API_DRIVER=http` in `.env`. The default install already includes `curl_cffi`, `cryptography` and `zstandard`.
2. Start the service. It discovers the workspace, mints a short-lived gateway token and opens the Noise WebSocket directly.
3. The driver creates an isolated muse.ai thread per API request and cleans up its uploaded reference files afterwards.

**Browser driver**

1. Install Chromium or Chrome and set `MUSE2API_DRIVER=browser` in `.env`.
2. Start the service. The browser driver opens a persistent profile and one isolated tab per account.

## API examples

Every `/v1/*` endpoint requires the header `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>`. The `/admin/*` endpoints use `MUSE2API_ADMIN_KEY`, which defaults to the API key when unset.

**Chat (streaming)**

```bash
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'
```

**OpenAI Python SDK**

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:18610/v1", api_key="<API_KEY>")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="muse-chat",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short poem about autumn"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Text to image**

```bash
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"A cyberpunk street on a rainy night","size":"16:9","response_format":"url"}'
```

**Transparent background**

muse.ai only returns flat RGB images, so `"background":"transparent"` cuts the subject out locally (BiRefNet + edge colour estimation) and returns an RGBA PNG. Requires `pip install -e '.[matting]'`; the model (~930MB) is downloaded to `~/.u2net` on first use. Expect ~30s extra per image on CPU.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"A red fox sitting","background":"transparent"}'
```

**Image from reference images**

`"image"` takes one reference image or a list of up to 4 (data URL, http(s) URL or bare base64). They are attached to the muse.ai message like a chat upload, and the prompt says how to use them, e.g. put a product on a model, or "the same fox, now wearing a red scarf" to keep the subject and scene. `/v1/images/edits` does the same with OpenAI-style multipart uploads, so `client.images.edit()` works; `mask` (inpainting a region) is not supported.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"A model wearing exactly this hoodie, studio photo","image":"data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}'

curl http://localhost:18610/v1/images/edits \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -F "image[]=@fox.png" -F "prompt=The same fox, now wearing a red scarf"
```

**Image as an async task**

A sync image call (page load plus generation) can take longer than a reverse proxy allows; Cloudflare cuts it after about 100 s with HTTP 524. Add `"async": true` to get a task back, then poll it. Results are always stored as media URLs.

```bash
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"A red fox sitting","async":true}'          # -> {"id":"task_xxx","object":"image.task",...}
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/images/generations/task_xxx -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**Text to video (async task)**

```bash
# Create a task; returns {"id": "task_xxx", "status": "queued", ...}
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/videos \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Maple leaves falling in a light breeze","duration":5,"size":"16:9"}'

# Poll the task; on success, result.url points to the video
curl http://localhost:18610/v1/videos/task_xxx -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**Import an account**

```bash
curl http://localhost:18610/admin/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"acc1","cookies":{"hatch_sess":"...","hatch_gw":"...","hatch_vml":"...","hatch_native_auth_device":"..."}}'
```

| POST | `/v1/responses` | Reserved, currently returns 501 |

### Dashboard, API keys and request log

Open `http://localhost:18610/dashboard` and enter the admin key; it is kept in the browser's local storage and sent as a Bearer token to `/admin/*`. The page shows request volume, error rate and latency, the account pool (enable/disable, renew, reset), a live request log, and API key management.

Besides the admin key and `MUSE2API_API_KEY` (still accepted, logged as `legacy`), `/v1/*` accepts any non-revoked key created on the dashboard or with `POST /admin/keys {"name": "..."}`. Keys look like `m2a-...` and are shown once; `data/keys.json` stores only their SHA-256 hash and an 8-character prefix. Every `/v1/*` request (except `/v1/media/*` downloads) is recorded in `data/requests.db` (SQLite) with its key, model, account, status, latency and client IP (`CF-Connecting-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For` aware). Task status polls are flagged so the dashboard and stats can leave them out.

## Configuration

All settings come from environment variables (prefix `MUSE2API_`) or a `.env` file. See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full list. The most common ones:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MUSE2API_DRIVER` | `mock` | Driver: `mock` / `browser` / `http` |
| `MUSE2API_HOST` · `MUSE2API_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` · `18610` | Listen address and port |
| `MUSE2API_API_KEY` | auto-generated | Key for `/v1/*` endpoints |
| `MUSE2API_ADMIN_KEY` | same as API key | Key for `/admin/*` endpoints |
| `MUSE2API_REQUEST_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` | `14` | Days of request history kept in `data/requests.db` |
| `MUSE2API_MEDIA_RETENTION_DAYS` | `14` | Days generated media files are kept in `data/media`; `0` disables automatic cleanup |
| `MUSE2API_STREAM_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | `0` | SSE `: keepalive` comment interval (seconds) while waiting for the first stream token; `0` disables |
| `MUSE2API_PUBLIC_BASE` | empty | Public base URL used in media links; derived from the request when empty |
| `MUSE2API_POOL_STRATEGY` | `lru` | Account scheduling: `lru` / `round_robin` / `affinity` |
| `MUSE2API_MAX_FAILOVER` | `2` | Maximum number of retries on another account |
| `MUSE2API_ACCOUNT_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `1` | Parallel requests per account (browser driver: one tab each); 4 works well |
| `MUSE2API_CHROMIUM_PATH` | auto-detected | Path to the browser executable (browser driver only) |
| `MUSE2API_KEEPALIVE_ENABLED` | `false` | Periodically renew sessions in the background |
| `MUSE2API_MATTING_MODEL` | `birefnet-general` | Model for `background: "transparent"` (`birefnet-general-lite` is faster) |

## Roadmap

All reserved modules and outstanding work are tracked in **[TODO.md](TODO.md)**, in four groups:

- **Verification and live testing (do first)**: get the tests passing, test the browser driver against real accounts, and verify live video generation and session renewal.
- **Drivers**: harden the direct HTTP driver (live video and quota lookup), conversation thread reuse.
- **Protocol**: `/v1/responses`, mask-based inpainting, emulated tool calling.
- **Accounts, admin and operations**: cookie import browser extension, storage backends, per-key rate limits, Prometheus metrics.

Each task lists its location, approach and definition of done. Places marked `TODO(contributors)` in the code are the reserved extension points.
